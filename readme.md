Dear Developer team, or Recruiting team
Here are the instructions on my idea of solution to test task.


! Description of the used technologies and technical description is in the resources.txt. Executables both for windows and linux (ubuntu 22.04) are 	available in the folder. Windows executables, can be simply opened like an 	app. !


0) Run server by running ts-node server.ts, 
or by running the executable I've included in the folder, in the terminal.

1) Run the client in the same way.

2) When connected to server, you'll be asked to provide a password,
password is: 1234.

3) After entering the password, you'll have three options, they'll be also displayed in the terminal.

4) If you provide 0, you'll see the list of possible opponents, if there are none, you'll be notified respectfully.

5) You'll need to copy an id of opponent, then enter 1, to request a match.
Afterwards, you'll need to paste id and type in your word.

6) then the match will start, and two players can start to give hints, and guesses.

7) Then if the opponent gives up, both users will be returned to the menu.
If the opponent guesses the word, they will be notified, and then returned to menu.

Thank you once again for your time, and consideration!
Kind Regards,
Ramil Gojayev.
